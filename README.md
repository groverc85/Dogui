# Dogui
tkinter based docker console.
This is a personal project and it's in very early state. The gui is ugly, there is no error control and just basic tasks are working right now.

## Installation

To run dogui it's necessary to install the python api for docker:

    pip install docker

This build has been tested with docker-py version 2.4.2 and and a docker API 1.24

Also tkinter libraries must be available.

## Usage

    dogui.py
